# 🖼️ ImageKit Production Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up ImageKit.io for production deployment of your Bethel Church website. ImageKit provides better performance, CDN delivery, and image optimization.

## Why ImageKit?
- **Better Performance**: Global CDN with faster image loading
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic compression and format conversion
- **Real-time Transformations**: Resize, crop, and transform images on-the-fly
- **Free Tier**: 20GB storage, 20GB bandwidth per month
- **Better Pricing**: More generous limits than other services

## Step 1: Get ImageKit Credentials

### 1.1 Sign Up for ImageKit
1. Go to [imagekit.io](https://imagekit.io)
2. Click "Get Started Free"
3. Sign up with your email
4. Verify your email address

### 1.2 Get Your API Keys
1. Log into your ImageKit Dashboard
2. Go to **Developer Options** → **API Keys**
3. Note down these values:
   - **Public Key** (e.g., `pk_abc123def456`)
   - **Private Key** (e.g., `private_xyz789uvw012`)
   - **URL Endpoint** (e.g., `https://ik.imagekit.io/your_username`)

## Step 2: Set Up Railway Environment Variables

### Option A: Using Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to the **Variables** tab
4. Add these environment variables:

```
IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=your_url_endpoint_here
```

### Option B: Using Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Set environment variables
railway variables set IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
railway variables set IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
railway variables set IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=your_url_endpoint
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Railway

### 3.1 Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add ImageKit production setup"
git push origin main
```

### 3.2 Monitor Deployment
1. Railway will automatically redeploy
2. Check the deployment logs
3. Look for: `🖼️ Using ImageKit for storage`

## Step 4: Test the Setup

### 4.1 Check Deployment Logs
In Railway dashboard, check the logs for:
- ✅ `🖼️ Using ImageKit for storage` - Success!
- ❌ `⚙️ Using local storage (ImageKit keys missing)` - Check environment variables

### 4.2 Test Image Upload
1. Visit your live site: `https://web-production-158c.up.railway.app/admin/`
2. Log in to Django admin
3. Upload an image to any model (Church, Event, etc.)
4. Check that the image URL points to ImageKit domain (`ik.imagekit.io`)

### 4.3 Verify Image Loading
1. Visit your live site
2. Check that images load correctly
3. Verify image URLs contain `ik.imagekit.io`

## Step 5: Upload Existing Media (Optional)

If you want to migrate existing images to ImageKit:

### 5.1 Run Upload Command
```bash
# On Railway (using Railway CLI)
railway run python manage.py upload_media_to_imagekit

# Or in Railway dashboard shell
python manage.py upload_media_to_imagekit
```

### 5.2 Dry Run First
```bash
# See what would be uploaded without actually uploading
railway run python manage.py upload_media_to_imagekit --dry-run
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Images not showing:**
- Check that environment variables are set correctly in Railway
- Verify ImageKit credentials have proper permissions
- Check Railway logs for storage backend messages

**Upload errors:**
- Ensure API credentials have upload permissions
- Check file size limits (ImageKit free tier: 25MB per file)
- Verify network connectivity

**Slow loading:**
- ImageKit CDN should be faster than local storage
- Check if images are being served from CDN
- Verify ImageKit URL endpoint is correct

### Environment Variable Checklist
- [ ] `IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY` is set
- [ ] `IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY` is set  
- [ ] `IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT` is set
- [ ] All variables are in Railway dashboard
- [ ] No extra spaces or quotes in values

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test storage configuration
python test_storage.py

# Test image uploads
python test_image_upload.py

# Test ImageKit setup
python setup_imagekit_production.py
```
